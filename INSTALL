nQuakesv for Linux
==================
To install nQuakesv, locate the installer tarball and extract it.


$ tar xvzf nquakesv11_installer.tar.gz


Once you have extracted the package, change directory to the folder that was
created (same as the package but without .tar.gz), run the install script and
follow the instructions.


$ cd nquakesv11_installer/
$ ./install_nquakesv.sh


Follow the instructions and answer the questions. Do not simply press ENTER
through the setup, or your server will be undistinguishable from others and
very insecure. If you have access to a full version of Quake, please specify
where pak1.pak is located to make the server more complete.

After installation has completed, copy the crontab line to your crontab and
your servers will be up and running in about 10 minutes.

Thank you for downloading nQuakesv

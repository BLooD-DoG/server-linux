nQuakesv for Linux
==================
To install nQuakesv, locate the installer tarball and extract it.


$ tar xvzf nquakesv_installer-linux-latest.tar.gz


Once you have extracted the package, run the install script.

$ ./install_nquakesv.sh

Follow the instructions and answer the questions. Do not simply press ENTER
through the setup, or your server will be indistinguishable from others and
very insecure. If you have access to a full version of Quake, please specify
where pak1.pak is located to make the server more complete.

Thank you for downloading nQuakesv
